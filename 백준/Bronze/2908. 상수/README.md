### Problem Description

<p>Sang-geun's younger brotherm Sang-soo, is truly terrible at math. He has trouble reading numbers. To help Sang-soo, who struggles with math, Sang-geun gave him a problem that required comparing the magnitudes of numbers. Sang-geun wrote two three-digit numbers on the board. Then he asked Sang-soo to name the larger number.</p>

<p>Constant reads numbers backwards, unlike most people. For example, if you write 734 and 893 on the board Constant reads them as 437 and 398. Therefore, Constant will say that 437 is the larger of the two numbers.</p>

<p>Write a program that outputs Constant's answer when given two numbers.</p>

### Input

 <p>The first line contains two numbers, A and B, written by Sanggeun on the board. The two numbers are three-digit numbers, unequal, and do not contain zeros.</p>

### Output

 <p>The first line prints the answer to the constant.</p>
