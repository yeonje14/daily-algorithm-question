### Problem Description

<p>One of the most common math problems is determining which quadrant a given point belongs to. As shown in the diagram, the quadrants are numbered from 1 to 4. "Quadrant n" means "the n-th quadrant."</p>

<p>For example, point A with coordinates (12, 5) lies in the 1st quadrant because both its x-coordinate and y-coordinate are positive. Point B, whose x-coordinate is negative and y-coordinate is positive, is in the 2nd quadrant.</p>

<p>Write a program that takes the coordinates of a point and determines which quadrant it belongs to. You may assume that both x and y are non-zero integers.</p>

### Input

 <p>The first line contains an interger X. And the second line contains an integer y . (−1000 ≤ x,y ≤ 1000; x, y ≠ 0)</p>

### Print

 <p>Print the quadrant number (1, 2, 3, or 4) where the point (x, y) is located.</p>
