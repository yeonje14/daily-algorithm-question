### Problem Statement

<p>Dohyun has N baskets, each numbered from 1 to N. Each basket contains one ball, and initially, the ball with the same number as the number on the basket is in the basket.</p>

<p>Dohyun wants to swap ball M. He selects two baskets to swap balls with, and swaps the balls in the two baskets.</p>

<p>Given how to change the balls, write a program that finds which balls are in each basket after changing the balls M times.</p>

### Input

<p>The first line contains N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100).</p>

<p>The second and subsequent M lines contain a method for exchanging balls. Each method consists of two integers, i and j, indicating the exchange of balls in the i and j baskets (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N)</p>

<p>Dohyun exchanges balls in the order given in the input.</p>

### Output

<p>Print the numbers of the balls in baskets 1 through N, separated by spaces.</p>
