    ### Problem Description

    <p>KOI Electronics is develpoing an artificial-intelligence oven that helps users easily cook healthy and delicious smoked duck. To use the AI oven, you simply place an appropriate amount of smoked-duck ingredients inside. The oven will then automatically calculate, in minutes, the time at which the cooking will be finished. </p>

    <p>On the front of the AI oven, there is a digital clock that displays the finishing time of the smoked-duck dish.. </p>

    <p>Given the starting time of the cooking and the required cooking duration in minutes, write a program to calculate the time at which the cooking will finish.</p>

    ### Input

    <p>The first line contains the current time: an integer hour A (0 ≤ A ≤ 23) and an integer minute B (0 ≤ B ≤ 59), separated by a space. The second line contains the cooking time C in minutes (0 ≤ C ≤ 1,000). </p>

    ### Output

    <p>Print the hour and minute of the finishing time, separated by a space. The hour must be between 0 and 23, and the minute between 0 and 59. If the time goes past 23:59, it wraps around to 00:00 as a digital clock normally does.</p>
