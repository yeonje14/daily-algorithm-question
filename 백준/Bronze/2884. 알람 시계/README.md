### Problem Description

<p>Sanggeun wakes up every morning to the sound of his alarm. It would be nice if he could wake up immediately, but he always ends up trying to sleep “just a little more,” which makes him late for school every day.</p>

<p>No matter what he tried, he just couldn’t get rid of that desire to sleep a bit longer..</p>

<p>Feeling sorry for Sanggeun, Changyoung recommended the method he personally uses.</p>

<p>It’s simple — “set the alarm 45 minutes earlier.”</p>

<p>The idea is straightforward: change the current alarm time to 45 minutes earlier. Since Sanggeun will snooze it anyway, he’ll still feel like he slept more, but he won’t be late for school.</p>

<p>Given the current alarm time Sanggeun has set, write a program to determine the new alarm time if he uses Changyoung’s method.</p>

### Input

 <p>The first line contains two integers H and M
(0 ≤ H ≤ 23, 0 ≤ M ≤ 59).
This represents the current alarm time: H hours and M minutes.</p>

<p>The time is given in 24-hour format.
In this format, the day starts at 0:0 (midnight) and ends at 23:59 (one minute before the next midnight).
Leading zeroes are not used unnecessarily.</p>

### Output

 <p>Print the alarm time Sanggeun should set when using Changyoung’s method.
The format should match the input format.</p>
