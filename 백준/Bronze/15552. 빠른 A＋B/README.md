### Problem Description

<p>A common math problem is to determine in which quadrant a given point lies. The quadrants are numbered from 1 to 4, as shown in the figure below. “Quadrant n” means “The nth Quadrant”.

For example, a point with coordinates (12, 5) has both x and y values positive, so it lies in Quadrant 1. If x is negative and y is positive, the point lies in Quadrant 2.

Write a program that receives the coordinates (x, y) of a point and prints the quadrant number (1, 2, 3, or 4) in which the point is located. You may assume that x and y are never 0. </p>

### Input

<p>The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. The following T lines each contain two integers A and B separated by a single space.

If you are using C++ and want to use cin/cout, apply both cin.tie(NULL) and sync_with_stdio(false), and use newline character (\n) instead of endl. Note that after applying these settings, you should not use C-style input/output functions like scanf, printf, getchar, etc.

If you are using Java, you may use BufferedReader and BufferedWriter instead of Scanner and System.out.println. Also, call BufferedWriter.flush() only once at the end.

If you are using Python, you may use sys.stdin.readline instead of input. Since it also captures the trailing newline, you may add .rstrip() when storing the string input.</p>

### Output

<p>For each test case, print the result of A + B, one result per line, in the same order as the input.</p>
