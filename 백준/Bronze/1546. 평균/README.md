### Problem Statement

<p>Sejun failed his final exam. He decided to manipulate his scores and take them home. First, he chose the highest score among his scores. Let's call this value M. Then, he converted all his scores to score M*100.</p>

<p>Foe example, if Sejun's highest score was 70 and his math score was 50, his math score would be 50/70*100 = 71.43.</p>

<p>Write a program that calculates the new average when Sejun's scores are recalculated using the method above.</p>

### Input

 <p>The first line contains the number of subjects tested, N. This value must be lesss than or equal to 1000. The second line contains Sejun;s current grade. This value must be a non-negative integer less than or equal to 100, with at least one value greater than 0.</p>

### Output 

 <p>The first line contains the new average. If the absolute or relative error between the actual answer and the output is less than or equal to 10<sup>-2</sup>, the answer is correct.</p>
