### Problem Description

<p>A common mathematical task is to determine which quadrant a given point belongs to. The quadrants are numbered from 1 to 4 as shown in the figure below. “Quadrant n” means the n-th quadrant.

For example:
	•	Point A at coordinates (12, 5) belongs to Quadrant 1 because both x and y are positive.
	•	Point B belongs to Quadrant 2 because x is negative and y is positive.

Write a program that takes a point’s coordinates (x, y) as input and outputs the number of the quadrant it belongs to.
It is assumed that both x and y are non-zero and are either entirely positive or entirely negative.
</p>

### Input
<p>The first line contains an integer x. (−1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x ≠ 0)
The second line contains an integer y. (−1000 ≤ y ≤ 1000, y ≠ 0) </p>

### Output
<p>Print a single integer: the quadrant number that the point (x, y) belongs to.
The output must be one of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
