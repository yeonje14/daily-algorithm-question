### Problem Description

<p>Dong-hyuk was rummaging through an old warehouse when he discovered a worn-out chessboard and chess pieces.</p>

<p>After dusting off the board and wiping it down with a cloth, it became a fairly usable chessboard. However, while all the black pieces were present, the number of white pieces was incorrect.</p>

<p>A complete set of chess consists of 16 pieces: 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, and 8 Pawns.</p>

<p>Given the number of white pieces Dong-hyuk found, write a program to calculate how many pieces need to be added or removed to form a complete set.</p>

### Input

<p>The first line contains the number of white kings, queens, rooks, bishops, knights, and pawns that Dong-hyuk found, separated by spaces. These values are integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10.</p>

### Output

<p>On the first line, output how many pieces need to be added or removed for each type in the order given in the input. If the number is positive, Dong-hyuk needs to add that many pieces; if it is negative, he needs to remove them.</p>
