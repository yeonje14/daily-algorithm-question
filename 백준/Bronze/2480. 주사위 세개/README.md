### Problem Description

<p>There is a game where you roll three dice, each showing a number from 1 to 6, and receive a prize according to the following rules:
<ol>
	<li>If all three dice show the same number, the prize is 10,000 + (number * 1,000) won. </li>
	<li>If exactly two dice show the same number, the prize is 1,000 + (number * 1,000) won. </li>
	<li>If all three numbers are different, the prize is (the largest number * 100) won. </li>
</ol>

<p>For example: if the dice show 3, 3, 6, the prize is 1,000+3*100 = 1,300 won.</p>

<p>Given the results of the three dice, write a program to calculate the prize</p>

### Input
