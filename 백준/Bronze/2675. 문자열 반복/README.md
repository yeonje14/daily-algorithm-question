### Problem Description

<p>Wrote a program that inputs a string S, repeats eacj character R time, creates a new string P, and then outputs it. That is, repeat the first character R times, the second character R times, and so on to create P. S contains only the characters "alphanumberic" from the QR code. </p>

### Input
 <p>The first line contains the number of test cases T(1 ≤ T ≤ 1,000). Each test case contains the number of iterations R (1 ≤ R ≤ 8) and a space-separated string S. The length of S must be at least 1 and no more than 20 characters.</p>

### Output

 <p>For each test case, output P.각 테스트 케이스에 대해 P를 출력한다.</p>
